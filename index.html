    At the time of making this website, I am 14 years old, attending Gunderson High School as a freshman. My goal is to help friends and classmates achieve and
    maintain good grades, in hopes of giving them a brighter future.<br><br><hr/><br>

    Ever since I learned about how a majority of students in some one my classes averaged a C grade, I felt embarassed for my generation. I wanted to help my friends
    and fellow classmates, as simply just waiting for them to grow up and still give barely any effort was far from the society I wanted. After , I started getting into 
    web development in hopes of finding a way to aid them. Although I've heard that "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink the water", I 
    wanted to make sure that the path to the "water" was made as easy as possible, so that students are more inclined to learn once they see that less work is required. <br><br>

    I first started off with learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites, and run said websites via Github pages. Github pages allows anyone to put a website online
    for free, but with no custom domain name (I'm unable to use <code>"www.mywebsite.com"</code>, or <code>"www.myotherwebsite.org"</code>. It must be <code>aaegis.github.io</code>). I first focused on
    creating a tool that would help with my English work, as it often requires mostly memorization for tests. It worked by generating a list of the words which were going to be
    on the test in a random order. The user could then copy that list and paste it into a text editor (Notepad, Google Docs, etc.). <br><br>

    You can see that website <a href="https://aaegis.github.io/vocabHelperV2/" class="text-decoration-none">here</a>. <br><br>

    Unfortunately, once development was finished, the website was made obsolete as no classwork needed it's use. Hopefully, it will find use later in the year, most likely once
    finals arrive. <br><br>

    Next, after a suggestion from my friend Harrison Nguyen, I developed a website similar to the "English Vocabulary Helper", but for Spanish. I simply copied over the files
    from my Vocabulary Helper and changed up the theme, as well as adding the Spanish words provided by my friend which his class needed to memorize. <br><br>
