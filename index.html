    At the time of making this website, I am 14 years old, attending Gunderson High School as a freshman. My goal is to help friends and classmates achieve and
    maintain good grades, in hopes of giving them a brighter future.<br><br><hr/><br>

    Ever since I learned about how a majority of students in some of my classes averaged a C grade, I felt embarassed for my generation. I wanted to help my friends
    and fellow classmates, as simply just waiting for them to grow up and still give barely any effort was far from the society I wanted. I started getting into 
    web development in hopes of finding a way to aid them. Although I've heard that "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink the water", I 
    wanted to make sure that the path to the "water" was made as easy as possible. Hopefully, that students are more inclined to learn once they notice less 
    work is required. <br><br>

    I first started off with learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites, and run said websites via Github pages. Github pages allows anyone to put a website online
    for free, but with no custom domain name (I'm unable to use <code>"www.mywebsite.com"</code>, or <code>"www.myotherwebsite.org"</code>. It must be <code>"aaegis.github.io"</code>). I first focused on
    creating a tool that would help with work from my English class, as it often requires mostly memorization for tests. The website worked by generating a list of the words 
    which were going to be on the test in a random order. The user could then copy that list and paste it into a text editor (Notepad, Google Docs, etc.). <br><br>

    You can view the aforementioned website <a href="https://aaegis.github.io/vocabHelperV2/" class="text-decoration-none">here</a>. <br><br>

    Unfortunately, once development was finished, the website was made obsolete as no classwork needed its use. Hopefully, it will find use later in the year, most 
    likely once finals arrive. <br><br>

    Next, after a suggestion from my friend Harrison Nguyen, I developed a website similar to the "English Vocabulary Helper", but for Spanish work in his class. 
    I simply copied over the files from my Vocabulary Helper and changed up the theme, as well as adding the Spanish words provided by my friend which his class 
    needed to memorize. <br><br>

    Afterwards, I started learning bootstrap, which allowed for a website's contents to be more "flexible", meaning that the website is able to adapt to the screen size of
    the viewer. I used <a href="https://w3schools.com/" class="text-decoration-none">w3schools.com</a> to learn bootstrap, which is how I was able to develop this website's "flexibility".
    This is especially important when it comes to mobile devices. I often post my work on Instagram for others to use. However, the website was built with a computer's screen
    in mind, which forced the viewer to have to copy the link, paste it on their computer, and use it there, unless they'd prefer using a less than ideal website layout. With 
    bootstrap however, the user would be able to study from their mobile devices, which is not only convenient, but a lot easier in case the user does not own a computer.
